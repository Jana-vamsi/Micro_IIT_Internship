# Student Management System (Console-Based in C++)

This project is a **console-based student management system** developed in C++. It allows the user to manage student records using simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## 🚀 Features

- 📅 Add new student records
- 📄 Display all student data
- 🔍 Search student by roll number
- ✏️ Update existing student details
- 🗑️ Delete all student records
- ❌ Exit the application

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++** for core logic
- **Google Colab / Python** was used as a shell to display/comment the C++ code

> ⚠️ Note: The code included is written in C++ but was embedded inside a Python (.ipynb/.py) file using Google Colab. You should extract and compile it as a `.cpp` file for proper use.

## 📂 File Structure

- `main.cpp` (contained within the Python script): The main source file for the Student Management System.

## 📸 Sample Output (Console)

```
Press 1 to Enter data

Press 2 to Show data

Press 3 to Search data

Press 4 to Update data

Press 5 to Delete data

Press 6 to Quit
```

## 📟 How to Run

1. Copy the C++ portion from the `.py` file.
2. Paste it into a file named `main.cpp`.
3. Compile and run using any C++ compiler, e.g.,

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o student_mgmt
./student_mgmt
```
